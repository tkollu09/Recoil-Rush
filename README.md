# Recoil-Rush
Short Unity platformer game with unique movement mechanic

NOT EVERYTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY IS CREATED BY ME!!! Only the C# code found in Recoil-Rush/Assets/Scripts

Commit 1: Day 1 of working on a short unity platformer game where the main movement mechanic uses recoil created using unity physics and mouse tracking. Created on LifeScript, MovementScript, ShootingScript.
